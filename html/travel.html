        <div class="writings">
            <p><span>In my last 3 years, I did  think  that traveling alone as a backpacker  changed me a lot. There are many ideas coming out during on my way. For example, before my experience of travelling, I never thought I gonna organize a donation for poor children.<br/><br/></span></p>
            <p><span>It makes me stronger, more mature and open minded. During 3 years, I have been to more than 6 countries and met people from more than 30 countries. Learning and  experiencing different cultures in the world,and I have been learning Spanish in Mexico for 1 year so that I can speak the 3 most world-wide languages : English, Chinese, Spanish. Which means I can communicate with 95% people in the world. That’s awesome.<br/><br/></span></p>
            <p><span>One of my hobbied on my way is talking  to travelers from other countried. Because they do really inspirited me a lot, I mean not like how to travel. It likes listening to someone’s true life story, what they thought of life. Then it makes me think what kind of way I wanna live. For example, I met a magician on the tramp in USA . I can still remember the day we met on the bus station. It surprised me when I found he was also a hitchhiker.  Then we were hitchhiking to his home, we did a lot crazy things such as making human pyramid for hitchhiking on the way. He lost all of his stuffs in Las Vegas. Then he earned money by making magic on the street. He was traveling from the west to the east without money and he loveed rock climbing so much. The last day we stayed in Starbucks for the farewell coffee, he got the message from his ex-wife and the picture of his daughter. He was crying like a baby on my shoulder. It's hard to explain what I learn form him but his story impressed me. There are other impressive guys such as a Canadian french teacher who have been to more than 100 countries and published 4 books.<br/><br/></span></p>
            <p><span>However, I have to thank my father sincerely for his backup. It’s rare to have a father like him in China. I’m a luck guy. I still remember the word my father said to me : “I don't demand you to be rich when you grow up, but I wish you live in a way you like, be healthy and happy .”<br/><br/></span></p>
            <p><span>Yes, I did as far as now.<br/><br/><br/></span></p>
